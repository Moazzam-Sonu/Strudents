# CRUD Web App with Next.js and .NET Core

This project demonstrates how to create a web application with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using Next.js for the frontend and .NET Core for the backend.

## Features
- üé® **Frontend**: Built with Next.js, featuring a simple UI to perform CRUD operations.
- üåê **Backend**: Developed with .NET Core, providing RESTful APIs for managing data.

---

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- üõ†Ô∏è Node.js (v16 or above)
- üñ•Ô∏è .NET SDK (v6 or above)
- ‚úèÔ∏è Visual Studio Code or any IDE of your choice

---

## Getting Started

### Clone the Repository
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_folder>
   ```

### Backend Setup (API)
1. üñ•Ô∏è Open the `Backend` folder in your IDE.
2. Run the following commands:
   ```bash
   dotnet new webapi -n StudentAPI
   cd StudentAPI
   dotnet restore
   ```
3. Add a model class for student data:
   ```csharp
   public class Student {
       public int RollNumber { get; set; }
       public string Name { get; set; }
       public string Course { get; set; }
   }
   ```
4. Add a controller to handle CRUD operations (e.g., `StudentsController`).
5. ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run the API:
   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```
6. Verify the API is running at `https://localhost:5001` or `http://localhost:5000`.

---

### Frontend Setup (Next.js)
1. üñ•Ô∏è Open the `Frontend` folder in your terminal.
2. Run the following commands to set up the frontend:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
3. üåç Access the frontend at `http://localhost:3000`.
